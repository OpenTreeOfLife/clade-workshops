# Clade workshops

Open Tree of Life and FuturePhy are holding a series of workshops on challenges of tree-data integration. See the original [call for proposals](https://futurephy.org/content/article/2-uncategorised/34-rfp-clade). We funded three initial workshops on catfishes, barnacles and beetles. 

## Dates and Location

## Before the event

If you have tasks that your group want to get done before the event, feel free to use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/OpenTreeOfLife/clade-workshops/issues) associated with this repository to track items. For example, you might want to upload specific trees to Open Tree of Life, or assemble trait data for Arbor analyses. We've created labels for each of the groups: [barnacles](https://github.com/OpenTreeOfLife/clade-workshops/labels/barnacles), [beetles](https://github.com/OpenTreeOfLife/clade-workshops/labels/beetles), [catfishes](https://github.com/OpenTreeOfLife/clade-workshops/labels/catfishes). 

For example, I've created an [issue asking everyone to add some information](https://github.com/OpenTreeOfLife/clade-workshops/issues/1) to the [participant list](https://github.com/OpenTreeOfLife/clade-workshops/wiki/Participant-list).
