# Saturday

* supertree using opentree; have ~20 studies; Chris has been running locally with treemachine; want to get into new method
  * worms taxonomy ok in some places, bad in some places
  * they have list of trees in spreadsheet (can we get these into a collection using a script or peyotl?)
  * what outgroups are we using?
  * look for new GenBank data (add to trees using Emily-Jane's new methods?)
* transcriptomes
  * want to look at gene expression data
  * no annotated genome
* phenotypic data 
  * larval info
  * morphology
  * paleo
  * host-parasite info
* branch lengths! plan to re-estimate on synthetic tree; Q about whether arbor has any features on brlens from partial data
  * have a large dated tree but then other trees that aren't dated; how to get branch lengths for edges that come from other trees (which do have brlens but not dates)
  * fossil record absent in some clades
